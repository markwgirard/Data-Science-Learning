# Machine Learning (Coursera)
Here are my solutions to all the programming assignments from Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). After completing this course you will get a broad idea of Machine learning algorithms. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code.

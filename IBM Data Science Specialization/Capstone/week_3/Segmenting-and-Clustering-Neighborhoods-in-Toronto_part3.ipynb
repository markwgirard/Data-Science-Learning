    "## Part 1\n",
    "1. Start by creating a new Notebook for this assignment.\n",
    "2. Use the Notebook to build the code to scrape the following Wikipedia page, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M>, in order to obtain the data that is in the table of postal codes and to transform the data into a pandas dataframe like the one shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To create the above dataframe:\n",
    " * The dataframe will consist of three columns: PostalCode, Borough, and Neighborhood\n",
    " * Only process the cells that have an assigned borough. Ignore cells with a borough that is **Not assigned**.\n",
    " * More than one neighborhood can exist in one postal code area. For example, in the table on the Wikipedia page, you will notice that **M5A** is listed twice and has two neighborhoods: **Harbourfront** and **Regent Park**. These two rows will be combined into one row with the neighborhoods separated with a comma as shown in **row 11** in the above table. (***Note:*** This problem seem to have been already corrected in the Wiki data.)\n",
    " * If a cell has a borough but a **Not assigned** neighborhood, then the neighborhood will be the same as the borough. (***Note:*** This problem seems to have been already corrected in the Wiki data.)\n",
    " * Clean your Notebook and add Markdown cells to explain your work and any assumptions you are making.\n",
    " * In the last cell of your notebook, use the **.shape** method to print the number of rows of your dataframe.\n",
    " \n",
    "4. Submit a link to your Notebook on your Github repository. (**10 marks**)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: There are different website scraping libraries and packages in Python. For scraping the above table, you can simply use *pandas* to read the table into a *pandas* dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way, which would help to learn for more complicated cases of web scraping is using the BeautifulSoup package. Here is the package's main documentation page: <http://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Use *pandas*, or the BeautifulSoup package, or any other way you are comfortable with to transform the data in the table on the Wikipedia page into the above pandas dataframe."
